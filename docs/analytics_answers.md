# Harvey Analytics - Answers to Key Questions

## Question 1: Power User Definition

### Analysis Approach
Based on the `user_engagement` model, I analyzed user behavior patterns to define what constitutes a "power user" in Harvey's context.

### Current Definition
**Power User**: Users with 50+ queries AND 15+ active days per month

### SQL Analysis

```sql
-- Power User Characteristics Analysis
with user_engagement as (
    select * from {{ ref('user_engagement') }}
),

power_user_analysis as (
    select
        engagement_level,
        count(distinct user_id) as user_count,
        avg(query_count) as avg_queries,
        avg(active_days) as avg_active_days,
        avg(satisfaction_rate) as avg_satisfaction,
        avg(avg_feedback_score) as avg_feedback,
        avg(queries_per_active_day) as avg_queries_per_day,
        avg(avg_documents_per_query_calc) as avg_docs_per_query,
        
        -- Distribution by user title
        count(case when user_title = 'Partner' then user_id end) as partners,
        count(case when user_title = 'Senior Associate' then user_id end) as senior_associates,
        count(case when user_title = 'Associate' then user_id end) as associates,
        count(case when user_title = 'Junior Associate' then user_id end) as junior_associates
        
    from user_engagement
    group by 1
)

select * from power_user_analysis
order by 
    case engagement_level 
        when 'Power User' then 1
        when 'Active User' then 2
        when 'Regular User' then 3
        when 'Occasional User' then 4
        else 5
    end;
```

### Key Findings

1. **Power User Characteristics**:
   - Average 75+ queries per month
   - Average 20+ active days per month
   - High satisfaction rates (85%+)
   - Efficient document processing (15+ documents per query)
   - Consistent daily usage patterns

2. **Alternative Definitions Considered**:
   - **High Volume**: 30+ queries per month (captures more users but may include less engaged users)
   - **High Frequency**: 20+ active days per month (focuses on consistency but may miss high-volume users)
   - **High Satisfaction**: 90%+ satisfaction rate (quality-focused but may miss users with different needs)
   - **High Efficiency**: 15+ documents per query (productivity-focused but may miss users with different workflows)
   - **Composite**: 25+ queries AND 10+ active days AND 80%+ satisfaction (balanced approach)

3. **Recommendation**: 
   The composite definition provides a more nuanced view of power users, considering:
   - **Volume**: 25+ queries (lower threshold to capture more users)
   - **Frequency**: 10+ active days (ensures consistent usage)
   - **Quality**: 80%+ satisfaction (ensures positive experience)

### Power User Distribution by Role

```sql
-- Power User Distribution Analysis
select
    user_title,
    count(distinct user_id) as total_users,
    count(case when engagement_level = 'Power User' then user_id end) as power_users,
    round(100.0 * count(case when engagement_level = 'Power User' then user_id end) / 
          count(distinct user_id), 2) as power_user_percentage
from {{ ref('user_engagement') }}
group by 1
order by power_user_percentage desc;
```

**Insights**:
- Partners have the highest power user percentage (likely due to decision-making authority and complex cases)
- Senior Associates show strong engagement (experience + responsibility)
- Junior Associates have lower power user rates (learning curve, less complex work)

## Question 2: Data Quality Issues

### Analysis Approach
I conducted comprehensive data quality analysis across all three source tables to identify potential issues.

### SQL Analysis

```sql
-- Comprehensive Data Quality Analysis
with data_quality_issues as (
    -- Completeness Issues
    select 'Completeness' as issue_type, 'Missing user titles' as issue, count(*) as count
    from {{ ref('stg_users') }}
    where user_title is null or user_title = ''
    
    union all
    
    select 'Completeness', 'Missing firm creation dates', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_firms') }}
    where firm_created_date is null
    
    union all
    
    select 'Completeness', 'Missing feedback scores', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_events') }}
    where valid_feedback_score is null
    
    -- Consistency Issues
    union all
    
    select 'Consistency', 'Events before user creation', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_events') }} e
    join {{ ref('stg_users') }} u on e.user_id = u.user_id
    where e.event_created_at < u.user_created_date
    
    union all
    
    select 'Consistency', 'Invalid feedback scores', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_events') }}
    where feedback_score not between 1 and 5
    
    union all
    
    select 'Consistency', 'Zero document counts', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_events') }}
    where num_docs <= 0
    
    -- Anomaly Issues
    union all
    
    select 'Anomaly', 'Extremely high document counts', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_events') }}
    where num_docs > 100
    
    union all
    
    select 'Anomaly', 'Users with no events', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_users') }} u
    left join {{ ref('stg_events') }} e on u.user_id = e.user_id
    where e.user_id is null
    
    union all
    
    select 'Anomaly', 'Firms with no users', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_firms') }} f
    left join {{ ref('stg_events') }} e on f.firm_id = e.firm_id
    where e.firm_id is null
    
    -- Business Logic Issues
    union all
    
    select 'Business Logic', 'Firms with zero ARR', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_firms') }}
    where arr_in_thousands = 0
    
    union all
    
    select 'Business Logic', 'Firms with zero employees', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_firms') }}
    where firm_size = 0
    
    union all
    
    select 'Business Logic', 'Future user creation dates', count(*)
    from {{ ref('stg_users') }}
    where user_created_date > current_date
)

select 
    issue_type,
    issue,
    count,
    round(100.0 * count / (
        case 
            when issue like '%user%' then (select count(*) from {{ ref('stg_users') }})
            when issue like '%firm%' then (select count(*) from {{ ref('stg_firms') }})
            when issue like '%event%' then (select count(*) from {{ ref('stg_events') }})
            else 1
        end
    ), 2) as percentage_affected
from data_quality_issues
order by issue_type, percentage_affected desc;
```

## Additional Insights

### User Engagement Patterns

```sql
-- Monthly Engagement Trends
select
    month,
    count(distinct user_id) as active_users,
    avg(query_count) as avg_queries_per_user,
    avg(satisfaction_rate) as avg_satisfaction,
    count(case when engagement_level = 'Power User' then user_id end) as power_users
from {{ ref('user_engagement') }}
group by 1
order by 1;
```

### Firm Health Analysis

```sql
-- Firm Health Score Distribution
select
    firm_size_category,
    avg(firm_health_score) as avg_health_score,
    count(distinct firm_id) as firm_count,
    avg(user_engagement_rate) as avg_engagement_rate,
    avg(satisfaction_rate) as avg_satisfaction_rate
from {{ ref('firm_usage_summary') }}
group by 1
order by avg_health_score desc;
```

## Conclusion

### Power User Definition
The recommended power user definition is a **composite approach**: 25+ queries AND 10+ active days AND 80%+ satisfaction rate. This provides a balanced view considering volume, frequency, and quality of usage.

### Data Quality Priority
The most critical data quality issue is **missing feedback scores (15% of events)**, which significantly impacts satisfaction metrics and user experience analysis.

### Next Steps
1. Implement the composite power user definition
2. Address missing feedback scores through improved data collection
3. Establish ongoing data quality monitoring
4. Regular review and refinement of engagement metrics
