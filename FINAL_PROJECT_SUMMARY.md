3. **`firm_performance`** - Firm-level performance metrics and ARR analysis
4. **`event_analytics`** - Event-level analytics with type distribution and performance metrics

### **Marketing Models (3)**
5. **`user_acquisition_base`** - Individual user acquisition data with activation categories and satisfaction analysis
6. **`user_acquisition_metrics`** - Aggregated user acquisition analysis with activation rates, quick start metrics, and satisfaction scores
7. **`event_performance_metrics`** - Multi-dimensional event performance analysis (daily/weekly/monthly) with user engagement and document processing analysis

## 🔍 **Data Quality Analysis Results**

### **Overall Score: 78.1%**
- ✅ **Perfect Completeness (100%)**: 0 missing values across all tables
- ✅ **Perfect Consistency (100%)**: All data within valid ranges
- ✅ **Perfect Business Logic (100%)**: No rule violations found
- ⚠️ **Statistical Anomalies (21.9%)**: 1,483 feedback outliers + 3,293 document count outliers

### **Key Discovery**: No firms with zero ARR (contrary to initial assumptions)

## 📈 **Model Execution Results**

### **Data Volume**
- **Total Events**: 18,832 records
- **Total Users**: 2,948 records
- **Total Firms**: 32 records
- **Date Range**: April 2024 - June 2024

### **Generated Outputs**
- **7 CSV Files**: Complete model outputs for analysis
- **Total Records Generated**: 26,676 across all models

### **Key Insights**
- **Engagement Pyramid**: 79.3% occasional users, 0.1% power users
- **Retention Patterns**: Strong retention in recent cohorts (50-60% by Month 5)
- **Activation Patterns**: 100% delayed activation (opportunity for improvement)
- **Event Performance**: Multi-dimensional analysis across daily/weekly/monthly time grains

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Python Data Quality Tools**
- **Streamlined Structure**: Removed 9 unnecessary files, reduced dependencies from 20+ to 8 essential packages
- **Model Simulation**: Complete dbt model simulation with CSV generation
- **Generated Outputs**: 7 CSV files
- **Statistical Analysis**: IQR-based outlier detection and trend analysis

### **dbt Testing Framework**
- **Generic Tests**: `not_null`, `unique`, `relationships`, `accepted_values`
- **Custom Tests**: Business logic validation using `dbt_utils.expression_is_true`
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing across staging and mart models

### **Data Models Features**
- **Metric Definitions**: Clear documentation of all business metrics

- Indicates strong product-market fit and user satisfaction
- Late activation patterns suggest onboarding optimization opportunities

### **3. Activation Opportunity**
- 100% eventual activation rate shows product value
- 0% quick start rate indicates onboarding improvement potential
- Focus on reducing time to first value

### **4. Event Performance**
- Multi-dimensional analysis across daily/weekly/monthly time grains
- Comprehensive performance metrics and growth tracking
- User segmentation analysis for targeted optimization
