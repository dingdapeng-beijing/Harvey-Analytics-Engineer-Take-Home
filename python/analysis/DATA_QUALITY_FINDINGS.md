# Harvey Analytics - Data Quality Analysis Findings

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Overall Data Quality Score: 78.1%**

The analysis of the Harvey Analytics platform data reveals a generally well-structured dataset with some specific areas for improvement. The data shows excellent completeness and consistency but has some statistical anomalies that should be investigated.

## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ **Strengths (What's Working Well)**

1. **Perfect Data Completeness (100%)**
   - No missing values in any table
   - All required fields are populated
   - No data gaps or null entries

2. **Excellent Data Consistency (100%)**
   - All feedback scores are within valid range (1-5)
   - No zero or negative document counts
   - Perfect timeline consistency (no events before user creation)
   - All event types are valid (ASSISTANT, VAULT, WORKFLOW)

3. **Strong Business Logic (100%)**
   - No firms with zero ARR (contrary to initial assumptions)
   - No firms with zero employees
   - No future date issues
   - All user titles are valid

4. **Good Data Structure**
   - Clear event type distribution
   - Realistic ARR and firm size ranges
   - Proper referential integrity

### ⚠️ **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Statistical Anomalies (21.9% of records affected)**
   - **Feedback Score Outliers**: 1,483 events (7.9%) have statistically unusual feedback scores
   - **Extreme Document Counts**: 3,293 events (17.5%) have document counts above the statistical upper bound

## 📈 Detailed Analysis

### Event Type Distribution
```
ASSISTANT: 8,425 events (44.7%)
VAULT:     5,567 events (29.6%)
WORKFLOW:  4,840 events (25.7%)
```

**Finding**: The distribution is well-balanced, with ASSISTANT being the most common event type, which aligns with expected usage patterns.

### Data Volume
- **Users**: 2,948 records
- **Firms**: 32 records  
- **Events**: 18,832 records
- **Total**: 21,812 records

### Business Metrics
- **ARR Range**: $35k - $1,000k (mean: $169k)
- **Firm Size Range**: 40 - 640 employees (mean: 145)
- **Feedback Score Range**: 1-5 (mean: 4.08)
- **Document Count Range**: 1-50 (mean: 8.21)

## 🔍 Anomaly Analysis

### Feedback Score Outliers
- **Statistical Method**: IQR-based outlier detection
- **Q1**: 4.00, **Q3**: 5.00, **IQR**: 1.00
- **Lower Bound**: 2.50, **Upper Bound**: 6.50
- **Outliers**: 1,483 events (7.9%)

**Interpretation**: The high number of outliers suggests that feedback scores are heavily skewed toward the upper end (4-5), which could indicate:
- Users are generally satisfied with the platform
- Potential bias in feedback collection
- Need for more granular feedback scales

### Extreme Document Counts
- **Statistical Method**: IQR-based outlier detection
- **Q1**: 1.00, **Q3**: 8.00, **IQR**: 7.00
- **Upper Bound**: 18.50
- **Extreme Cases**: 3,293 events (17.5%)

**Interpretation**: The high number of events with >18 documents suggests:
- Some users are processing large document batches
- Potential power users or bulk operations
- May need investigation for data entry errors

## 🚨 **Critical Finding: No Zero ARR Firms**

**Contrary to Initial Assumptions**: The analysis found **0 firms with zero ARR**, which contradicts the business logic issue mentioned in the project documentation. This suggests that either:
1. The data has been cleaned since the initial analysis
2. The issue was resolved in the data pipeline
3. The initial assessment was incorrect

## 💡 Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Investigate Feedback Score Distribution**
   - Analyze why feedback scores are heavily skewed toward 4-5
   - Consider implementing more granular feedback scales
   - Review feedback collection process for potential bias

2. **Review High Document Count Events**
   - Investigate events with >18 documents for data quality
   - Verify if these represent legitimate bulk operations
   - Consider implementing validation rules for extreme values

### Medium Priority
3. **Establish Data Quality Monitoring**
   - Set up automated alerts for statistical anomalies
   - Monitor feedback score distributions over time
   - Track document count patterns

4. **Data Quality Dashboard**
   - Create ongoing monitoring for the identified anomalies
   - Set up thresholds for alerting on unusual patterns
   - Implement trend analysis for business metrics

### Low Priority
5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update project documentation to reflect actual data quality status
   - Remove references to non-existent issues (zero ARR firms)
   - Document the statistical anomaly thresholds

## 📊 Visualizations Generated

The analysis created four comprehensive visualizations:

1. **`event_type_distribution.png`** - Event type breakdown and percentages
2. **`missing_values_analysis.png`** - Missing data analysis (shows no missing values)
3. **`business_logic_analysis.png`** - ARR distribution, firm sizes, and business logic issues
4. **`consistency_analysis.png`** - Feedback scores, document counts, and consistency checks

## 🎯 Conclusion

The Harvey Analytics data shows **excellent data quality** with perfect completeness, consistency, and business logic. The main areas for attention are statistical anomalies in feedback scores and document counts, which may represent legitimate business patterns rather than data quality issues.

**Recommendation**: Focus on understanding the business context of the statistical anomalies rather than treating them as data quality problems, as they may represent normal usage patterns for power users or bulk operations.

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Business Context Review**: Discuss the anomalies with business stakeholders
2. **Threshold Adjustment**: Consider adjusting statistical thresholds based on business understanding
3. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Implement the recommended monitoring systems
4. **Documentation Update**: Update project documentation with actual findings
