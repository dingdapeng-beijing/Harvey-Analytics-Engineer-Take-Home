### **User Engagement Model Improvements**
Added comprehensive metric definitions in the model header:

```sql
/*
METRIC DEFINITIONS:

1. SATISFACTION SCORES:
   - Source: feedback_score from events table (1-5 scale)
   - High Satisfaction: feedback_score >= 4 (80%+ satisfaction rate)
   - Low Satisfaction: feedback_score <= 2 (40% or lower satisfaction rate)
